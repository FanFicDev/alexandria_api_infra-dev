The contents of this repository should let a user run a dev instance of the
Alexandria API through docker.

Currently Alexandria's prod environment depends on a few things to be fully
functional:
	postgresql
	nginx
	uwsgi

The first is setup by the docker-compose.yml file, but the latter two are
currently missing in lieu of Flask's development web server.

Just run
	./build.sh && docker-compose up
to build, run, and tail the logs. The local instance of Alexandria will be
available on :59394 .
